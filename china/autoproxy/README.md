This list was created from [AutoProxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autoproxy/), who actively maintain
the list in their [open source repo](https://code.google.com/p/autoproxy-gfwlist/). They do all the hard work, this
version is just an attempt to format their list in to something [Lantern](http://getlantern.org) can understand.

This version was made in October of 2013. Downloaded the autoproxy firefox plugin, copied everything they had in their
in to sublime text, and then did various regex and de-duplication clean up. Lantern does not use or respect
domain prefixes, so I tried to remove all of them. For sites like google that are only partially blocked I erred on 
the side of access.

Contributions to this list are appreciated - the core lantern team will not have time to maintain it. Just make
pull requests of things to add / remove. For this file it should be from the autoproxy list. If you want to make
a unique list then just make one in a folder besides this. Create pull requests and the team will approve them.
